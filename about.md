### A little about me

I’m a designer at Bray Leino and a one man studio at home in North Devon. I've designed a multitude of media. From marketing sites to mobile web apps, friendly personalised portfolios to global marketing campaigns, pitch winning presentations to interactive experiential pieces.

My main interests are digital design and illustration. Got an interesting project or collaboration idea? Don’t hesitate to ask me anything.
